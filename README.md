# Roadmap

- Upload photos of separate recyclables - file upload, image processing
- Public website with anonymous aggregate data (e.g. "green" neighbourhoods) - SEO, Google Analytics
- Recyclate report w/ quantity per type (e.g. 8 kg plastic) and grade (A+ = clean & 100% recyclable)
- Automatic routing (maximize collection, minimize distance) - travelling salesman problem?
- Request pick up or wait for next scheduled pick up
- Send messages to assigned collector/past collectors - say thank you, develop connection
- Receive notification of next visit, collector nearby, collector arrived, recyclables sorted etc.
